Follow my journey here:

Instructions:

1. Follow the instructions for running C++ https://exercism.org/tracks/cpp

2. The `test` sub-folders have been excluded but are provided when downloading directly from Exercism.org, due to size of the [catch](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/tree/v2.x) library inside. A copy has been left in a top-level folder. Paste this into any directory before running cmake commands.
